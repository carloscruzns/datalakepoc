# Data Lake Proof of Concept 
This repository contains the materials to be used in a saga of medium articles detailing how to build a PoC for a Data Lake. If you are an expert in AWS or aren't that familiar with it, there's something you can learn with this project. There is a document avaliable with a more detailed guide in this repository so you can follow along. I recommend attempting to do it without the detailed guide and finding ways to get it done, but it is available if it is required.  The links for the articles are:
